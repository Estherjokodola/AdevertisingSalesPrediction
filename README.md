## Project Overview

The Advertising Sales Prediction project aims to help businesses in the advertising industry forecast their sales based on historical data and various factors, such as ad spend, audience demographics, and time of year. Accurate sales predictions enable companies to optimize their advertising strategies, budget allocation, and revenue projections.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to create a predictive model that can:

- Forecast advertising sales accurately, enabling better decision-making for marketing and sales teams.
- Identify the most influential features or factors affecting sales.
- Provide insights into how different variables impact advertising sales.

## Methods

To achieve the project's objectives, the following methods and techniques are employed:

1. **Data Collection**: Make use of data attached in the repository.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean, transform, and normalize the data to make it suitable for analysis. This includes handling missing values and outliers.

3. **Feature Engineering**: Create and select relevant features for the predictive model. This might include time-based features, interaction terms, and data aggregation.

4. **Predictive Models**: Employ regression models, such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting, to predict advertising sales based on the selected features.

5. **Evaluation Metrics**: Assess model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.

6. **Feature Importance Analysis**: Analyze the importance of different features in predicting sales to understand which factors have the most significant impact.

7. **Visualization**: Visualize the predictions, actual sales, and feature importance to provide actionable insights.

## Data Sources

Data sources for this project may include:

- Historical advertising sales records
- Advertising campaign details
- Advertising budget and spending data
- Demographic information about the target audience
- Time-based data (e.g., daily, weekly, or monthly)

Ensure that you have access to relevant data for training and testing the predictive model.

## Usage

To use the Advertising Sales Prediction project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Prepare your advertising sales data and place it in the appropriate data directory.
3. Install the necessary dependencies (see [Dependencies](#dependencies)).
4. Run the provided Jupyter notebooks or scripts to preprocess data, train predictive models, and evaluate their performance.
5. Analyze the results and use the insights gained to optimize advertising strategies.
